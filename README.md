## Dataset

Obtained from Kaggle competetion of Advanced Regression Techniques

## Description

– Domain: Machine Learning(Regression)

78 features of a house using data analysis, visualisation for feature selection.

– Used principal component analysis(PCA) on the selected features to further reduce the dimensionality
of the data

– Developed a stacking Ensemble regression model consisting of various gradient boosting and lasso regressors
as estimators followed by Ridge regressor to predict the house prices
